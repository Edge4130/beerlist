      what: "What you smell before you sip. Worth 12 of the 50 points, because aroma carries most of what we call flavor.",
      how: "Swirl, then take a few short sniffs right away. Aroma fades fast as the beer warms and the foam settles, so judge it first. Smell again later; some notes open up as it warms.",
    },

      { key: "malt", label: "Malt", scale: NLMH, tags: "malt",
        tip: { what: "Smells from the grain. Pale malts read like crackers or bread dough, kilned malts like toast or caramel, roasted malts like coffee or dark chocolate.",
          how: "Think bakery. If it smells like a bread aisle, a caramel candy, or a coffee shop, that's malt." } },
      { key: "hops", label: "Hops", scale: NLMH, tags: "hops",
        tip: { what: "Smells from the hops, a flower used like a spice. American hops lean citrus, pine, and tropical fruit. European hops lean floral, herbal, spicy, earthy.",
          how: "Think produce section and garden. Grapefruit peel, mango, pine needles, fresh-cut flowers, or black pepper usually point to hops." } },

        tip: { what: "Smells made by the yeast. Ale yeast can add fruit (banana, pear, apple) or spice (clove, pepper). Lager yeast should smell clean, letting malt and hops show.",
          how: "If a fruit or spice note isn't explained by malt or hops, it's probably yeast. A German hefeweizen smelling like banana and clove is the classic example." } },

        tip: { what: "The foam's texture. Rocky: thick, uneven peaks that stand up, common in Belgian ales and wheat beers. Small: fine, tight bubbles that look creamy. Effervescent: big, fizzy bubbles that pop quickly, like soda. Mixed: a blend of bubble sizes.",
          how: "Look right after the pour, then again a minute later. Foam is built from malt proteins and hop compounds, so a beer with no head at all may be undercarbonated or poured into a greasy glass." } },

      { key: "hops", label: "Hops", scale: NLMH, tags: "hops",
        tip: { what: "Hop flavor is the taste of the hop itself, separate from bitterness: citrus, tropical fruit, pine, herbs, flowers, spice.",

      { key: "bitterness", label: "Bitterness",scale: NLMH,
        tip: { what: "Bitterness comes mostly from hops boiled in the beer. It's the drying, slightly sharp sensation that balances malt sweetness, measured in IBU.",
          how: "Feel for it at the back of your tongue and in the aftertaste. Think black coffee, grapefruit pith, or dark chocolate. A light lager sits near 10 IBU, a West Coast IPA can pass 60." } },
      { key: "ferm", label: "Fermentation", scale: NLMH, tags: "ferm",
        tip: { what: "Yeast flavors: fruity esters like banana, pear, or apple, spicy phenols like clove or pepper, tartness from souring bacteria, or a clean, crisp lager profile.",
          how: "Clean is a real answer. In a lager, tasting nothing from the yeast means it did its job." } },

        tip: { what: "Whether hops (bitterness and hop flavor) or malt (sweetness and grain) leads. Hoppy-leaning beers taste sharp, dry, and bright. Malty-leaning beers taste round, sweet, and bready.",
          how: "Compare an IPA (hoppy) with a German bock (malty). Judge the balance against the style; a malty IPA or a bitter bock is off target." } },
      { key: "finish", label: "Finish", scale: ["Dry", "", "Med", "", "Sweet"], ends: true,
        tip: { what: "How the beer ends after you swallow. Dry beers leave your mouth clean and ready for the next sip. Sweet beers linger, sometimes sticky.",

    key: "mouthfeel", label: "Mouthfeel", max: 5,

      { key: "body", label: "Body", scale: ["Thin", "M", "Full"],
        tip: { what: "The beer's weight on your tongue. Leftover sugars, proteins, and oats or wheat add body.",
          how: "Think skim milk to whole milk. A light lager is thin, an imperial stout is full." } },
      { key: "carbonation", label: "Carbonation", scale: NLMH,
        tip: { what: "The fizz level.",

        tip: { what: "The warming sensation from alcohol.",
          how: "Pleasant and gentle in strong styles like barleywine. In a normal-strength beer, or when it burns like a shot, it's a problem." } },

        tip: { what: "A soft, smooth, velvety texture.",
          how: "Oatmeal stouts, nitro pours, and hazy IPAs are often creamy. Think of the feel of a milkshake versus a soda." } },
      { key: "astringency", label: "Astringency", scale: NLMH,
        tip: { what: "A puckering, drying, rough feeling, like over-steeped black tea or a dry red wine. Not the same as bitterness.",
          how: "Rub your tongue on the roof of your mouth after a sip. A sandpapery feel is astringency. Usually a flaw." } },
